# Time Series Alignment with Dynamic Time Warping (DTW)

This repository demonstrates how to preprocess, analyze, and align time series data using **Dynamic Time Warping (DTW)**.  
It includes utilities for data cleaning, scaling, and experimenting with different distance metrics to improve alignment accuracy.  

---

## Contents
- `dtw.ipynb` – Jupyter Notebook with the full DTW pipeline (preprocessing, scaling, alignment, visualization)  
- `dtw_test.csv` – Sample dataset for testing DTW implementations  
- `report.pdf` – Detailed report describing the methodology, experiments, and findings  

---

## Key Features
- **Preprocessing**: Handle raw time series, normalization, and scaling  
- **DTW Alignment**: Implement DTW with flexible distance metrics  
- **Visualization**: Compare time series alignment results   

---

## Goal
Provide a hands-on exploration of **Dynamic Time Warping** as a fundamental tool for measuring similarity and aligning time series data.
